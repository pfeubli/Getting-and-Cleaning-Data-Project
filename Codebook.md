# Tidy Data Set

## Data

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

For each record it is provided:
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
* The activity 
* The average of every measurement for every activity and every subject

## Variables

### Identifiers
Integers from 1 to 30 (variable name = Subject)

### Activities
* Walking (variable name = WALKING)
* Walking upstairs (variable name = WALKING_UPSTAIRS)
* Walking downstairs (variable name = WALKRING_DOWNSTAIRS) 
* Sitting (variable name = SITTING)
* Standing (variable name = STANDING)
* Laying (variable name = LAYING)
